# Why
I wanted to express my feelings towards my daugther Eleanor for her first birthday. I hope she comes to enjoy programming as much as I do one day. This is a working program and prints out:

```
We waited so long for you to arrive.
We fell in love with you the moment you came.
Now that you are in our arms and home with us.
We look forward to watching you grow.
```

# Usage
Execute in VS or VSCode or Atom with the [Ionide](http://ionide.io/) extension.

# Inspiration
[The dev aspect](https://www.youtube.com/c/thedevaspect) tutorials helped me greatly with putting this together when introduced to an immutable state machine. Also to [Jacques](https://github.com/jpfuentes2) for writing an amazing [letter](https://github.com/jpfuentes2/a-letter-to-Augusta) to his daughter.
